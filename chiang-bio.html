Dr. Chiang is an Action Editor of GeoInformatica (Springer) and an editorial board member for Transactions in GIS (Wiley). He earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Southern California and his bachelor's degree in Information Management from the National Taiwan University. Dr. Chiang's research interests are in spatial artificial intelligence, where he develops machine learning methods to leverage location and time information in data to understand complex environmental phenomena and human-environmental interactions. He works with multi-modal and multi-scale data containing explicit or implicit location and time information, such as traffic, air quality, satellite imagery, images, and text documents, for extracting valuable insights from heterogeneous data and solve real-world problems. Dr. Chiang has received funding from various organizations, including NSF, NIH, DARPA, NGA, NEH, and industry partners such as NTT Global Networks, BAE Systems, Conveyancing Liability Solutions, TerraGo, and Rumsey Map Collection. He has also worked as a visiting researcher at Google AI in New York City and a machine learning consultant at the Spatial Computing Group at Meta. Before pursuing his Ph.D., Dr. Chiang worked as a research scientist for Geosemble Technologies and Fetch Technologies in California, where he co-invented a patent on geospatial data fusion techniques. Dr. Chiang is also the founder of Kartta Foundation, a non-profit organization that provides software and services to distill and assemble geographic knowledge for the public good. Kartta Foundation manages Kartta Labs, a previous Google product, including re.city.</span></p>
