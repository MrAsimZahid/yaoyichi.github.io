<p>Yao-Yi Chiang, Ph.D., is an Associate Professor (Research) in Spatial Sciences, the Director of the Spatial Computing Laboratory, and the Associate Director of the NSF's Integrated Media Systems Center (IMSC) at the University of Southern California (USC). He is also a faculty member in Data Science in the USC Viterbi Data Science M.S. program. He is an Action Editor of GeoInformatica (Springer). Dr. Chiang received his Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from the University of Southern California, his bachelor's degree in Information Management from the National Taiwan University. His current research combines spatial science theories with computer algorithms to discover useful insights from heterogeneous data for solving real-world problems. His research interests include information integration, machine learning, data mining, computer vision, and knowledge graphs. He has received funding from agencies such as NSF, NIH, DARPA, NGA, and NEH, as well as from industry partners such as NTT Global Networks, BAE Systems, Conveyancing Liability Solutions, and TerraGo. He was recently a visiting researcher at Google AI (NYC). Before USC, Dr. Chiang worked as a research scientist for Geosemble Technologies and Fetch Technologies in California. Geosemble Technologies was founded based on a patent on geospatial data fusion techniques, and he was a co-inventor.</p>
